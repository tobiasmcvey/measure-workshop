# Measure Workshop

This is a method I've developed to help teams define specific things to measure. It is intended for product and service development.

In brief, this is a workshop method that will help your team answer the following questions

* Why we measure: What are we trying to achieve
* What we measure: What is valuable to the team and the end user, a person who could be a customer, citizen, caretaker, employer or anything else really
* How we measure it: How are we going to collect the information we need to answer our questions

The process starts with abstract questions and gradually hones in on truly specific definitions you can track, such as metrics and questions in a survey, interviews and user testing.

I have conducted similar workshops in the past for product development companies and adapted it so it can be used in other industries including but not limited to retail and government services.
